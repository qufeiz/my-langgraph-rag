Speaking of editing the graph, all of the controls for modifying or sharing the graph are found by clicking the \u201cEdit Graph\u201d button. Clicking the button causes a panel to slide out from the left. Changes to the graph can be made while viewing the graph. You can even mouse-over the graph to see the latest values or change the date range without closing the panel.  Another new feature is the ability to share a graph with an automatically updating time range. Click the share icon on the slide-out panel, select the type of link you want, and select how you want the graph to update.  Now if you\u2019ll just follow me to the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll notice our related content. As we make our way to the related content, we\u2019ll pass our new Notes section, which is a handy place to find a link to the source of the data.

        "Subtitle": "Recent Posts",
        "Date": "January 11, 2016",
        "Content": "\u00a0 Do you have 10 minutes? If so, you can master 10 FRED tools. This set of lessons is based on an Econ Lowdown activity found here. Let\u2019s get started. 1. \u00a0Find Real GDP (Series ID: GDPC1) Real GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year calculated by using a base year\u2019s price for goods and services. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reports this key indicator every three months.  A page of search results will appear.  FRED automatically creates an up-to-date line graph of U.S. real GDP measured in billions of 2009 dollars.  2. \u00a0Shorten the Graph Date Range by Clicking the \u201c10yr\u201d Setting Notice that FRED created a graph of real GDP with dates ranging from 1947 through the latest reported data. The beginning and ending dates of the observation period are noted in the boxes on the top right of the graph. You can customize the graph\u2019s date range with a variety of tools. Let\u2019s use the simplest tool to narrow the real GDP graph to the past 10 years of data.  3. \u00a0Mouse Over Any Point on the Line to View Values By default, FRED\u2019s Tooltip feature is active. Move the mouse cursor along the plot line on the graph and each value along the line will show in a box. Try it below.  4. \u00a0Convert the Graph from a Line Graph to a Bar Graph With FRED, line graphs are just the beginning. In the \u201cGraph\u201d tab, under \u201cGRAPH SETTINGS,\u201d click the drop-down menu under \u201cGraph type.\u201d Select \u201cBar\u201d from the list. The data automatically convert to a bar graph.  5. \u00a0Transform the Graph Frequency from Quarterly to Annual Quarterly real GDP growth rates are informative, but what if your real interest is the annual growth rate? You can easily change the frequency shown.  FRED automatically aggregates quarterly data values, averaging them into annual values.  6. \u00a0Change the Units from Billions of 2005 Dollars to a Compounded Annual Rate of Change  Up to this point, the GDP data displayed by FRED have consisted of real values reported in billions of chained 2005 dollars. Using a measure of dollars from a base year allows year-to-year comparison without distortions resulting from changes in the overall price level (inflation). More commonly, however, real GDP is reported in terms of the annual percentage growth rate rather than inflation-adjusted dollars. FRED makes this data transformation easy, too.  The newly transformed graph now displays GDP\u2019s compounded annual growth rate, adjusted for inflation.  7. Change the Graph Color  This next activity is more cosmetic than macroeconomic. FRED allows you to customize the color of the graphed element.  Once again, FRED auto-updates.  8. Turn Off Recession Bars The shaded gray area covering late 2007 through 2009 indicates the most recent recession as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\u00a0This shading is often referred to as a recession bar. In this case, the shading aligns with a contraction in real GDP growth. Recession bars may be turned off.\u00a0In the \u201cGraph\u201d tab, click on \u201cGRAPH SETTINGS.\u201d Next to \u201cRecession bars, click the \u201cOff\u201d button.  9. Enlarge the Graph by Choosing a Size: \u201cX-Large\u201d under Graph Settings FRED\u2019s attractive and informative custom graphs are perfect for reports, presentations, and web pages. Precise sizing is easy.  10. Share FRED Graphs FRED offers a variety of ways to share graphs, including through email, social media, and embedding on your blog. To share a graph, click the \u201cShare\u201d tab (next to the \u201cGraph\u201d tab) and select among the options. ",
